I focus on development and application of statistical signal processing and
machine learning algorithms for a variety of applications. In particular, I am
interested in theoretical under-pinning and hidden behaviors of ML algorithms
and what can be understood better about them in terms of classical statistics.

== Interests and Philosophy of Research
I am always attempting to abide by the following life (and career) principles:\n

• *Learning*: I am always trying to become a better engineer and researcher. I
am always absorbing lessons from my own and others’ experience, as well as
reading and keeping up with trends in my field. I also very much enjoy the
teaching process, it is gratifying to help other come to an understanding of
a topic and to strengthen and question my own knowledge of the field.\n
• *Leadership*: I enjoy and work at understanding the big picture in order
to stay on target and to help others do the same. I try to be intentional
and to take ownership of my deliverables. I also recognize that sometimes
others are more suited to a particular task. A good leader creates environments
and teams that don’t need them.\n
• *Teamwork*: Excellent research and products require teamwork, collaboration,
and respect for one another. Being right is feels nice, but it always comes in
second-place behind what is good for the project and the team.\n
• *Hard Work*: A successful project is always the result of much striving and
frustration. I push hard on a project and catalog all paths until a solution
is found. I find the learning along the way and the hard-won results to be
rewarding twin goals.\n

My technical strengths include:\n

• *Algorithm development*, including initial prototyping from research papers,
progressive improvements and novels approaches, all the way through practical
implementation and infrastructure choices (database, message-queues,
containerization, etc.).\n
• *Statistical signal processing*, where I have worked on several challenging
problems in tracking and filtering, time-series smoothing, phase reconstruction,
high-dimensional model-order selection, etc.\n
• *Optimization*, where I have worked on a variety of convex-relaxations of
NP-hard problems (TSP, cost assignment, constrained resource allocation, etc.).\n
• *Machine learning*, with experience in anomaly detection, natural language
processing, and computer vision utilizing a variety of existing and in-house
developed solutions including ensemble methods, deep-learning, and
high-dimensional correlation analysis.\n
