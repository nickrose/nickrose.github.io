== Brief Biography

Nick attended Colorado State University where he received his Bachelors degree
(2005, summa cum laude) in electrical engineering and subsequently obtained
his Masters (2007) in the same and focused on signal processing. He worked
at Numerica Corp. from 2007 to 2009 on algorithms for track decorrelation
and ambibuity assessment in data association, and on stochastic modeling;
working at Numerica again in 2013 on the resolution of tracking ambiguity
through use of Dempster-Shafer theory and Smets' transferable belief model
for class identification, as well as for class uncertainty quantification
and sensor reliability modeling.\n
\n
In 2013 he obtained his Phd in electrical engineering from Kansas State
University. \n
\n
From 2013 to 2014 he lectured on signal processing and control theory at
Universit√§t Paderborn (Germany) and researched low-sample-support methods
for correlation analysis of high dimensional data sets. He was employed at
ISA from 2014 to 2017 and worked on tracking, optimization, and statistical
signal processing algorithms. From winter 2017 to Summer 2018 he worked
on anomaly detection and machine learning algorithms as a Senior Data and
Algorithms Scientist at Alchemy IoT. Current, he is a senior research
scientist work for Formulus Black on algorithm improvement and integrating
machine learning into the operational algorithms related to data redundancy
reduction, cluster server load balancing, and various other benchmarking and
algorithmic experiments towards improved system performance.
\n

His work and research-related interests include statistical signal processing,
machine learning, and optimization.
