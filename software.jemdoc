= Software
The following software programs were utilized or developed mostly while at university and during post-doctoral research.

== Werkzeuge und Werkzeugkasten
=== Personal Website tools/example
- [http://www.github.com/nickrose/nickrose.github.io github.io] website (this site) with
[http://jemdoc.jaboc.net jemdoc]\n
create your own website, see the github repo for tools to setup
a similar site and scrap publications from Google Scholar using a tor service,
see the [./create_pubs.py +create_pubs.py+] script (it's tricky since GS
doesn't like people running web scrapers on their site).
=== Statistics and Machine Learning
- [https://github.com/nickrose/ICtoolbox IC toolbox]\nModel-order selection for high-dimensional, low-sample support correlated data
- [https://github.com/cjlin1/libsvm/tree/master/ SVM toolbox]\n
 Support vector machine implementation in C, Python, and Matlab. By Chih-Jin Lin.
 - [https://github.com/nickrose/eeg_ML EEG NN] and [https://github.com/nickrose/gait_processing Gait NN]\n
 Example uses of convlutional NN on EEG and gait datasets.
=== Optimization
- [https://developers.google.com/optimization/ OR-tools]\n
Open-source package for solving various operations research -related optimization problems.
- [https://github.com/nickrose/tsp_algo TSP solver]\n
A simple module and some jupyter notebooks for playing with simulated Traveling Salesman problems.
- [http://github.com/nickrose/MISTWF-toolkit-simulation MISTWF toolbox]\n
(gitHub) Matlab minimum increment space-time water filing algorithm and test bed. By yours truly.
=== Filtering and Estimation
- [http://www.lce.hut.fi/research/mm/ekfukf/ EKF/UKF Kalman filtering toolbox]\n
Matlab filtering toolbox, visualization, and various dynamic models. by Simo Särkkä, and Jouni Hartikainen.
