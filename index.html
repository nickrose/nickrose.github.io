Research Scientist<br>
Featured research: High-dimensional Statistical Modeling,

<p><br>
I focus on development and application of statistical signal processing and
machine learning algorithms for a variety of applications. In particular, I am
interested in theoretical under-pinning and hidden behaviors of ML algorithms
and what can be understood better about them in terms of classical statistics.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>Interests and Philosophy of Research</h2>
<p>I am always attempting to abide by the following life (and career) principles:<br></p>
<p>• <b>Learning</b>: I am always trying to become a better engineer and researcher. I
am always absorbing lessons from my own and others’ experience, as well as
reading and keeping up with trends in my field. <br>
• <b>Leadership</b>: I enjoy and work at understanding the big picture in order
to stay on target and to help others do the same. I try to be intentional
and to take ownership of my deliverables. I also recognize that sometimes
others are more suited to a particular task. A good leader creates environments
and teams that don’t need them.<br>
• <b>Teamwork</b>: Excellent research and products require teamwork, collaboration,
and respect for one another. Being right is feels nice, but it always comes in
second-place behind what is good for the project and the team.<br>
• <b>Hard Work</b>: A successful project is always the result of much striving and
frustration. I push hard on a project and catalog all paths until a solution
is found. I find the learning along the way and the hard-won results to be
rewarding twin goals.<br>
• <b>Mentoring</b>: I also very much enjoy the
teaching process, it is gratifying to help other come to an understanding of
a topic and to strengthen and question my own knowledge of the field. A test of 
the competence and value of the knowledge you bring is whether you can helpfully 
guide and instruct others. I have lead teams of engineers and data scientists and 
encouraged their upskilling, technical researches, and personal growth.<br></p>
<p>My technical strengths include:<br></p>
<p>• <b>Algorithm development</b>, including initial prototyping from research papers,
progressive improvements and novels approaches, all the way through practical
implementation and infrastructure choices (database, message-queues,
containerization, etc.).<br>
• <b>Statistical signal processing</b>, where I have worked on several challenging
problems in tracking and filtering, time-series smoothing, phase reconstruction,
high-dimensional model-order selection, etc.<br>
• <b>Optimization</b>, where I have worked on a variety of convex-relaxations of
NP-hard problems (TSP, cost assignment, constrained resource allocation, etc.).<br>
• <b>Machine learning</b>, with experience in anomaly detection, natural language
processing, and computer vision utilizing a variety of existing and in-house
developed solutions including ensemble methods, deep-learning, and
high-dimensional correlation analysis.<br></p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>Philosophy of Teaching</h2>
<p>My teaching philosophy is centered on the belief that good education:<br>
• Should be an active, student-centered process that prepares individuals for success in their personal and professional lives.<br>
• Emphasizes an attentiveness to the material and being will to make and learn from mistakes. <br>
• Incorporates individual student projects and practical experiences.<br>
• Should create a dynamic and engaging learning environment that fosters critical thinking and creativity.<br>
• Promotes lifelong love of learning and the ability to engage thoughtfully with any subject.<br></p>
