<h1>Statistical Signal Processing and Machine Learning </h1>
<p>I focus on development and application of statistical signal processing and machine learning algorithms for a variety of applications. In particular, I am interested in theoretical under-pinning and hidden behvaiors of ML algorithms and what can be understood better about them in terms of classical statistics.</p>
<h2>Interests and Philosophy of Research </h2>
<p>I am always attempting to abide by the following life (and career) principles:
• <b>Learning</b>: I am always trying to become a better engineer and researcher. I am always absorbing lessons from my own and others’ experience, as well as reading and keeping up with trends in my field. I also very much enjoy the teaching process, it is gratifying to help other come to an understanding of a topic and to strengthen and question my own knowledge of the field.<br />
• <b>Leadership</b>: I enjoy and work at understanding the big picture in order to stay on target and
to help others do the same. I try to be intentional and to take ownership of my deliverables. I also recognize that sometimes others are more suited to a particular task. A good leader creates environments and teams that don’t need them.<br />
• <b>Teamwork</b>: Excellent research and products require teamwork, collaboration, and respect for one another. Being right is feels nice, but it always comes in second-place behind what is good for the project and the team.<br />
• <b>Hard Work</b>: A successful project is always the result of much striving and frustration. I push hard on a project and catalog all paths until a solution is found. I find the learning along the way and the hard-won results to be rewarding twin goals.<br /></p>
<p>My technical strengths include:<br />
• <b>Algorithm development</b>, including initial prototyping from research papers, progressive
improvements and novels approaches, all the way through practical implementation and infrastructure choices (database, message-queues, containerization, etc.).
• <b>Statistical signal processing</b>, where I have worked on several challenging problems in tracking and filtering, time-series smoothing, phase reconstruction, high-dimensional model-order selection, etc.
• <b>Optimization</b>, where I have worked on a variety of convex-relaxations of NP-hard problems (TSP, cost assignment, constrained resource allocation, etc.).
• <b>Machine learning</b>, with experience in anomaly detection, natural language processing, and computer vision utilizing a variety of existing and in-house developed solutions including ensemble methods, deep-learning, and high-dimensional correlation analysis.</p>
